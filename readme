Introduction
============

This tool provides a simple interface to read 3d model, convert off file to 
pcd file, and implement SD algorithm by C++ program in Ubuntu. 
It is very easy to use by only call the API function. 

Usage
=====

You can use simply as my main.cpp file.


Other Utilities
===============

You can usage the pcl_viewer exec file to visualize .pcd file (point cloud of 3d model)
